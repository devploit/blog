Hi, I'm Daniel Púa (a.k.a. devploit) and I'm an infosec lover from Cádiz (Spain). I'm living on Malaga where I work and do my stuff. I also participate in CTFs as a hobby. My teams are [ripp3rs](https://ctftime.org/team/50984) & [R3Vengers](https://ctftime.org/team/175470).

I'm currently working at [Freepik Company](https://www.freepikcompany.com/) as Security Tech Lead.

In addition to working and participating in CTFs I also (try to) maintain a repository of payloads that may be useful for other security researchers. You can visit it at: [pwny.cc](https://www.pwny.cc).

This page will be mainly focused on Information Security posts, such as CTF write-ups, research papers and similar pieces.

If you have any doubt/question, feel free to contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/devploit).
